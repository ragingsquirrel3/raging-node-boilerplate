# React Flexy Chart

This is my personal boilerplate for a configurable d3 react chart.

## Install

run `npm install` and edit dependencies at package.json

## Tests

Run mocha tests via `npm test` and run all tests in /test directory.

## Run Development Environment
run `npm install` if you haven't already installed dependencies.
run `npm start`

then open http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/
